This dataset consist a 721 pokemons of the 1 to 6 Generations, including several features like stats, types, catch rate, if the pokemon is legendary and others, totaling 21 variables. With him we will try to answer the fallowing questions:

* How the amount of pokemons is distributed per generation?
* Is there missing data in this dataset?
* Is there any relationship between the type of pokemon and it's color?
* Which pokemons have the highest attributes values? and lowest?
* Are there correlations between other attributes?
* Can we find clusters among pokemons?
* Can we create a classifying model for legendary pokemons?
