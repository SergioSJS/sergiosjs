      <description>In this project it was verified my reinforcement learning algorithm and test the deep-q-learning applying in Atari games. Also check the domain adaptation technique in 2 games of Atari 2600, Space Invaders and Demon Attack, games with similar gameplay and style. The goal of creating a generalist model capable of playing more than one game and trying to help it converge more quickly. We noticed that the domain transfer slowed learning but allowed a higher score at the beginning of the training.</description>
