      <description>In this project it was verified my reinforcement learning algorithm and test the deep-q-learning applying in Atari games. Also check the domain adaptation technique in 2 games of Atari 2600, Space Invaders and Demon Attack, games with similar gameplay and style. The goal of creating a generalist model capable of playing more than one game and trying to help it converge more quickly. We noticed that the domain transfer slowed learning but allowed a higher score at the beginning of the training.</description>

      <description>A simple test with Keras and MNIST to assess impact by varying hyperparans to predict numerical characteres. The best result can be seen in the image below.</description>

      <description>The best deep representation level is the FC2 deep-feature, contain the most relevant features to classify. Early fusion and Late fusion can&amp;rsquo;t better than only FC2 deep feature. Lastly the Bagging approach achieved the best results of all experiments executed.
The domain of food is hard to classify, even for humans. This happens due to similarity between food made with the same ingredients wich belongs to different classes. Even so the deep feature FC2 showed up a good option and the Bagging technique is the best model.</description>
